	This is a webpage verifying <b>Monty Hall problem</b>, that is:<br> 
	assume that you are in a reality show,<br> 
	and there are three doors in front of you.<br> 
	Behind the doors are a car and two goats unoderedly.<br>
	You can go home with the one behind the door you choose.<br><br>
	after you randomly choose, the host of the reality show would open a door with a goat behind it, <br>
	and then ask you if you would like to switch your choice,<br>
